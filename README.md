# WordPress Seller Quiz

## Introduction

The Seller Quiz allows users to create a multiple choice quiz that will help potential home buyers decide whether or not they're ready to buy.

The plugin hooks into FrontDesk using the official API to sync the data of the person taking the quiz.

The website owner is able to collect the name, email, and address information of the user and has a new potential customer.
